The conditions are as follows:\n","\n","* The first nonzero entry in each row, called a **pivot** entry (a.k.a. **leading entry**), is strictly to the right of the pivot in the preceding row.\n","* All zero rows are at the bottom of the matrix.\n","\n","The matrix below, assuming $A_{1,1}$, $A_{2,3}$, and $A_{2,4}$ are non-zero, is an example of a matrix in row echelon form.
